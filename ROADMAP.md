# LethalMic Mod Development Roadmap

## Project Overview
This document tracks all changes made to the LethalMic mod during our development session, from initial analysis to final implementation of echo prevention and audio processing fixes.

## Initial Problem Analysis

### Original Issues Identified
1. **UI Settings Not Applied**: Settings were saved to configuration but not applied to audio processing
2. **Basic Audio Processing**: Only gain and simple noise gate were applied, ignoring advanced processors
3. **Configuration Binding Conflict**: InvalidCastException due to duplicate configuration binding
4. **Echo/Feedback Loop**: Microphone picking up speaker audio and creating echo loops

### Root Cause Analysis
- **Disconnected Processing Pipeline**: Advanced audio processors existed but were never called
- **Missing Integration**: No connection between UI settings and actual audio processing
- **Configuration Conflicts**: StaticAudioManager trying to bind already-bound configuration keys
- **Speaker Audio Bleed**: Microphone sensitivity causing feedback loops in Lethal Company

## Phase 1: Audio Processing Pipeline Integration

### Files Modified: `src/plugins/LethalMic/Audio/Management/StaticAudioManager.cs`

#### Complete Rewrite of Audio Processing System
- **Added Audio Processors Integration**:
  - `AINoiseSuppressionProcessor` - AI-powered noise reduction
  - `AdvancedEchoCanceller` - Echo cancellation (later disabled)
  - `SpectralSubtractionProcessor` - Frequency-domain noise reduction
  - `VoiceDuckingProcessor` - Voice ducking for game audio
  - `AudioCompressorProcessor` - Dynamic range compression

#### New Processing Pipeline

## Phase 2: Configuration Binding Fix

### Problem: InvalidCastException
```
[Error  : LethalMic] Error initializing audio system: System.InvalidCastException: Specified cast is not valid.
```

### Root Cause
StaticAudioManager was trying to bind configuration keys that were already bound in LethalMicStatic, causing type conflicts.

### Solution Applied
- **Removed Duplicate Configuration Binding**: Eliminated config binding from StaticAudioManager
- **Updated Method Signatures**: Removed unused ConfigFile parameter
- **Cleaned Up Variables**: Removed unused gain, noiseGate, and Config variables
- **Updated Device Selection**: Now uses LethalMicStatic.GetInputDevice()

### Files Modified: `src/plugins/LethalMic/Audio/Management/StaticAudioManager.cs`
- **Removed Configuration Binding**: Lines 51-53 that caused InvalidCastException
- **Updated Initialize()**: Removed config parameter and binding logic
- **Updated StartRecording()**: Uses LethalMicStatic.GetInputDevice()
- **Cleaned Up Imports**: Removed unused BepInEx.Configuration import

### Files Modified: `src/plugins/LethalMic/Core/LethalMicStatic.cs`
- **Updated StaticAudioManager.Initialize()**: Removed ConfigFile parameter
- **Maintained Configuration**: All configuration still handled in LethalMicStatic

## Phase 8: Build Error Fix - BasePreprocessingPipeline Issue

### Problem: Compilation Errors
```
error CS0246: The type or namespace name 'BasePreprocessingPipeline' could not be found
```

### Root Cause Analysis
The `BasePreprocessingPipeline` class from the Dissonance library was not found during compilation. This could be due to:
1. **API Changes**: Dissonance library may have changed class names or namespaces
2. **Missing References**: The DissonanceVoip.dll reference might not include this class
3. **Version Mismatch**: The class might exist in a different version of Dissonance
4. **Namespace Issues**: The class might be in a different namespace than expected

### What BasePreprocessingPipeline Was Supposed To Do

#### Primary Purpose
The `BasePreprocessingPipeline` was designed to intercept Lethal Company's voice chat system at the Dissonance level to apply our advanced audio processing before the audio reaches the game's voice transmission system.

#### Key Functions
1. **ProcessMicrophoneData Interception**: 
   - Intercepts raw microphone data before it's processed by Dissonance
   - Applies our audio processing pipeline (noise suppression, compression, etc.)
   - Returns processed audio to Dissonance for transmission

2. **TransmitAudio Interception**:
   - Intercepts audio just before transmission to other players
   - Applies final processing (echo cancellation, final noise reduction)
   - Ensures processed audio is what gets sent to other players

#### Why It's Important
- **Direct Integration**: Bypasses the need for external audio routing
- **Seamless Experience**: Players don't need to configure external audio software
- **Real-time Processing**: Audio is processed in real-time during voice chat
- **Game Integration**: Works directly with Lethal Company's voice system

### Temporary Solution Applied

#### Files Modified: `src/plugins/LethalMic/Patches/VoiceChatPatch.cs`
- **Commented Out Dissonance Patches**: Temporarily disabled all BasePreprocessingPipeline patches
- **Preserved Processing Logic**: Kept all audio processing methods intact
- **Added Documentation**: Clear comments explaining why patches are disabled
- **Maintained Structure**: Code structure preserved for future re-enabling

#### Current State
- **Build Success**: Mod now compiles without errors
- **Core Functionality**: All audio processing still works through StaticAudioManager
- **Manual Integration**: Users need to route audio through external software for now
- **Future-Ready**: All code structure maintained for easy re-enabling

### TODO: Re-enable BasePreprocessingPipeline Integration

#### Research Required
1. **Dissonance API Documentation**: Find current Dissonance class names and namespaces
2. **Version Compatibility**: Check which Dissonance version Lethal Company uses
3. **Alternative Classes**: Look for alternative classes that provide similar functionality
4. **Namespace Investigation**: Explore Dissonance namespaces for correct class names

#### Implementation Plan
1. **API Research**: 
   - Decompile DissonanceVoip.dll to find actual class names
   - Check Lethal Company's Dissonance version
   - Research Dissonance documentation for current API

2. **Alternative Approaches**:
   - Look for `IVoicePreprocessor` or similar interfaces
   - Check for `VoiceProcessor` or `AudioProcessor` classes
   - Investigate `Dissonance.Voip` namespace for relevant classes

3. **Testing Strategy**:
   - Test with different Dissonance class names
   - Verify patches work without breaking voice chat
   - Ensure audio processing is applied correctly

#### Priority Level: HIGH
This integration is crucial for the mod's user experience. Without it, users need to:
- Configure external audio routing software
- Manually set up audio processing chains
- Deal with potential audio latency issues

#### Success Criteria
- [ ] Find correct Dissonance class names
- [ ] Patches compile without errors
- [ ] Voice chat continues to work normally
- [ ] Audio processing is applied to transmitted audio
- [ ] No performance impact on voice chat

### Files Modified: `src/plugins/LethalMic/Patches/VoiceChatPatch.cs`
- **Commented Dissonance Import**: Temporarily disabled using Dissonance namespace
- **Disabled Harmony Patches**: Commented out BasePreprocessingPipeline patches
