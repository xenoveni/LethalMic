## üì¶ Installation

### Prerequisites
- Lethal Company (Steam)
- BepInEx 5.4.x
- .NET Framework 4.7.2 or newer

### Installation Methods
1. **r2modman (Recommended)**
   - Search for "LethalMic" in the mod browser
   - Click install and enable in your profile

2. **Manual Installation**
   - Download the latest release
   - Extract to `BepInEx/plugins/LethalMic`
   - Launch the game

## üì¶ Dependencies

LethalMic requires the following mods to function correctly:

- [BepInExPack (BepInEx-BepInExPack)](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/BepInEx/BepInExPack/) - Core modding framework
- [InputUtils (Rune580-LethalCompany_InputUtils)](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/Rune580/LethalCompany_InputUtils/) - Advanced input handling for Unity mods

These dependencies are automatically handled by r2modman/Thunderstore, but if you install manually, ensure both are present in your `BepInEx/plugins` folder.

> **Technical Note:**
> When specifying InputUtils as a dependency for Thunderstore/r2modman, use the string: `Rune580-LethalCompany_InputUtils-0.7.10` (with underscores, not dots).
